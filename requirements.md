  - Sprint/Distance Running: Support logging runs with metrics for distance (km/miles), time, pace, splits, and heart rate (if integrated). Allow creation of running-specific routines, such as interval training or long-distance plans.
- **Search and Filtering**: Advanced search by name, muscle group, equipment, or type, with autocomplete and filters. Highlight targeted muscle groups visually (e.g., body map).

### 3. Routine Building and Planning
- **Routine Creation**: Users can build unlimited routines, adding exercises, sets, reps, weights, rest times, and notes. Support supersets, circuits, dropsets, and warmup sets.
- **Pre-Built Routines**: Provide a library of ready-made routines (e.g., beginner strength, full-body, split programs), which users can copy and customize.
- **Periodization and Goal-Based Planning**: Generate intelligent workout progressions based on user goals and current performance. When users set strength goals (e.g., increase 1RM by 10% in one month), the application creates a periodization schedule with suggested weights and rep ranges for future workouts. The system considers current 1RM estimates, training history, and progressive overload principles to optimize progression paths.
- **Speed and Power Periodization**: Create specialized training programs for speed and power development with structured phases (e.g., general preparation, specific preparation, competition). Programs automatically adjust training variables including distance, intensity, rest periods, and exercise selection to avoid plateaus and optimize acceleration, max velocity, and power output.
- **Plyometric Program Planning**: Generate progressive plyometric training programs with graduated intensity levels, volume progression, and recovery protocols. Include sport-specific movement patterns and jumping progressions designed to improve reactive strength, power, and athletic performance.
- **Sprint-Specific Training Plans**: Structured interval training programs focused on sprint technique and the different phases of sprinting (acceleration, max velocity, speed endurance). Include technique drills, resisted/assisted sprinting protocols, and speed development methodologies with automatic progression based on performance improvements.
- **Intelligent Workout Suggestions**: For future workouts, automatically suggest appropriate weights and rep ranges based on periodization principles, recent performance, and established training methodologies. For speed/power training, suggest optimal rest intervals, training intensities, and exercise progressions based on current performance levels and training phase.
- **Scheduling**: Allow scheduling routines on a calendar (daily, weekly), with reminders via email or browser notifications.
- **Folders and Organization**: Organize routines into folders for easy management.
- **Customization Options**: Include RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) scale for intensity tracking, plates calculator for barbell loading, and custom notes per set or exercise.

### 4. Workout Logging
- **Real-Time Logging**: Intuitive interface to start a routine and log sets as completed, inputting weights, reps, time, distance, or other metrics. Auto-save progress to prevent data loss.
- **Timers and Tools**: Built-in rest timers, stopwatch for timed exercises (e.g., planks, runs), and auto-fill suggestions based on previous logs.
- **Editing and History**: Edit past logs, view unlimited workout history, and add notes or photos (e.g., form check).
- **Support for Extended Workouts**: Log plyometric sessions with comprehensive jump metrics including height, distance, contact time, and reactive strength measurements. Track running workouts with GPS simulation or manual input for distance/time/pace. Record speed training sessions with precise timing for sport-specific tests and drills, including split times and performance analysis.

### 5. Progress Tracking and Analytics
- **Statistics and Graphs**: Display progress charts for strength gains (e.g., 1RM estimates, volume over time), body measurements, and workout consistency. Include advanced analytics like personal records (PRs), trends per exercise/muscle group, and comparisons over time.
- **One Rep Max (1RM) Calculations**: Automatically calculate estimated one rep max for each exercise based on completed weight and reps using established formulas (e.g., Brzycki, Epley). For example, if a user completes bench press with 200lbs for 8 reps, the application calculates an estimated 1RM of approximately 253.8lbs. Track 1RM progress over time with visual charts and historical data.
- **Speed and Power Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of athletic performance metrics including best times for sport-specific distances (40-yard dash, 100m, agility drills), vertical jump progression, broad jump improvements, and sprint split analysis. Generate power-speed profiles, acceleration curves, and performance trend analysis with automatic detection of personal bests and performance plateaus.
